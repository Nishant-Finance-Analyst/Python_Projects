# Comprehensive Portfolio Analysis and Risk Assessment using Python
• Utilized yfinance to fetch historical closing prices and market capitalization data for a selected set of Indian stocks.

• Leveraged pandas for data manipulation and calculated portfolio weights based on market capitalization, with daily
returns computed for the portfolio.

• Employed numpy and scipy.stats to compute various risk metrics including Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at
Risk (CVaR), Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and annualized return and volatility.

• Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn for heatmaps and cumulative return plots, and performed Monte
Carlo simulations to forecast potential portfolio returns.
